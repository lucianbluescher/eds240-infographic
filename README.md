## Project Overview

This repository contains my **EDS 240 Final Project**: a data-driven infographic that argues for the strategic development of **hydropower and multi-purpose reservoirs** as critical solutions for global decarbonization and climate change adaptation.

### Project Goal

The final infographic positions hydropower as a superior alternative to carbon-intensive energy sources while highlighting the need for a strategic, multi-purpose approach to dam development.
